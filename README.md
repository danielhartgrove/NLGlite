# NLGlite
### A Lightweight NLP Solution Authored by Daniel Hartgrove for Dissertation Project @ The University of Nottingham (COMP3003)
#### Supervised by Dr I Knight, Authored by Daniel Hartgrove

## Abstract
This project was developed as a part of my dissertation for my Batchelor's degree at the University of Nottingham.

## Dependencies
This project requires that you have Python 3 install. This can be installed (here)[https://www.python.org/downloads/]

## How to Run
This project is delightfully simple to install and run:
- Simply download the files
- Navigate to their location using your preferred terminal
- Run the the command `python3 main.py`
- The project will now run

## Capabilities
Currently, this project is able to produce syntactically correct, but limited nonsense text. It does this using a Markov Driven Grammar, based on the work of Markov, Chomsky, Kelmendi and Compton.
In the future, these sentences _should_ make sense all the time.
