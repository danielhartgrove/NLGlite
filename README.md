# NLGlite
A Lightweight NLP Solution Authored by Daniel Hartgrove for Dissertation Project @ The University of Nottingham (COMP3003). Supervised by Dr I Knight.

## Abstract
This project was developed as a part of my dissertation for my Batchelor's degree at the University of Nottingham. You can read my dissertation, when published [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Dependencies
This project requires that you have Python 3 install. This can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How to Run
This project is ~~delightfully simple~~ easy to install and run:
- Simply download the files from this page
- Download NLTK by opening your preferred terminal and using the command `pip install nltk`
- Then use your preferred terminal to navigate to the location of the project files
- Run the command `python3 train_model.py` to train the model on a .txt file of your choice. This will provide the model with words to use, by default ~~nothing will be produced~~
- Run the command `python3 main.py` to run the model

## Capabilities
Currently, this project is able to produce syntactically correct, but limited nonsense text. It does this using a Markov Driven Grammar, based on the work of Markov, Chomsky, Kelmendi and Compton.
In the future, these sentences _should_ make sense all of the time.

## References
Properly formatted references will be added shortly
